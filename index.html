  <h1>Web Development Contract</h1>
<h2>Between {{ contractorName }} and {{clientName}}</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>

<p><span class="wewill"></span> always do <span class="our"></span> best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it's important to have things written down so that <span class="we"></span> both know what's what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won't find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We've no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What <span class="we"></span> do want is what's best for both parties, now and in the future.</p>

<h4>So in short;</h4>

  <p>You, {{clientName}}, located at {{clientAddress}}, are hiring <span class="us"></span>, {{contractorName}}, located at {{contractorAddress}}, to design and develop a web site for the <span class="worktype"></span> of ${{price}} as outlined in <span class="our"></span> previous correspondence. Of course it's a little more complicated, but <span class="wewill"></span> get to that.</p>

<h4>What do both parties agree to do?</h4>

<p>You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You'll give <span class="us"></span> everything <span class="we"></span> need to complete the project as and when and in the format <span class="we"></span> need it. You'll review <span class="our"></span> work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates <span class="we"></span> set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>

<p><span class="us"></span>: <span class="we"></span> have the experience and ability to do everything we've agreed with you and <span class="wewill"></span> do it all in a professional and timely manner. <span class="wewill"></span> endeavour to meet every deadline that's set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.</p>
  
<h3>Getting down to the nitty gritty</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>

<p><span class="we"></span> create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. <span class="we"></span> create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so <span class="we"></span> won't waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. <span class="we"></span> may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (colour, texture and typography.) <span class="we"></span> call that ‘design atmosphere.'</p>

<p>You'll have two or more weekly opportunities to review <span class="our"></span> work and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you're not happy with the direction <span class="our"></span> work is taking, you'll pay <span class="us"></span> in full for everything we've produced until that point and cancel this contract.</p>

<h4>Text content</h4>

<p><span class="were"></span> not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you'd like <span class="us"></span> to write new content or input text for you, <span class="we"></span> can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

  <h4>Photographs</h4>

<p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, <span class="we"></span> can suggest stock libraries. If you'd like <span class="us"></span> to search for photographs for you, <span class="we"></span> can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

<h4>HTML, CSS and Javascript</h4>

<p><span class="we"></span> deliver templates developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive Javascript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.</p>

<h4>Browser testing</h4>

<p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>

<h4>Desktop browser testing</h4>

<p><span class="we"></span> test <span class="our"></span> work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. <span class="wewill"></span> also test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly different, experience. <span class="wewill"></span> implement a single column design for Internet Explorer 7 and below for Windows and <span class="we"></span> won't test in other older browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, <span class="we"></span> can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

<h4>Mobile browser testing</h4>

<p>Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person's experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they're using. <span class="we"></span> test <span class="our"></span> work in:</p>

<p>iOS: Safari, Google Chrome and Opera Mini  Android 4.1: Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera Mini Android 3.2: Browser, Firefox and Opera Mini</p>

<p><span class="we"></span> currently don't test Blackberry OS or Blackberry QNX, Opera Mobile, Symbian or other mobile browsers. If you need <span class="us"></span> to test using these, <span class="we"></span> can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

<h4>Technical support</h4>

<p><span class="were"></span> not a website hosting company so <span class="we"></span> don't offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don't, <span class="we"></span> can set up an account for you at one of <span class="our"></span> preferred hosting providers. <span class="we"></span> can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and <span class="we"></span> can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.</p>

<h4>Changes and revisions</h4>

<p><span class="we"></span> know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. <span class="we"></span> don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time <span class="we"></span> estimate <span class="wewill"></span> need to accomplish everything you've told <span class="us"></span> you want to achieve, but <span class="were"></span> happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won't be a problem as <span class="wewill"></span> provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

<h4>Legal stuff</h4>

<p><span class="we"></span> can't guarantee that <span class="our"></span> work will be error-free and so <span class="we"></span> can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised <span class="us"></span> of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">Phew.</p>

<h4>Copyrights</h4>

<p>First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you've permission to use them.</p>

<p>Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:</p>

<p>You'll own the visual elements that <span class="we"></span> create for this project. <span class="wewill"></span> give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as <span class="were"></span> not  to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.</p>

<p><span class="wewill"></span> own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and <span class="wewill"></span> license that you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless <span class="we"></span> agree otherwise. <span class="we"></span> can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

<p><span class="we"></span> love to show off <span class="our"></span> work and share what we've learned with other people, so <span class="we"></span> reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of <span class="our"></span> portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>

<p><span class="were"></span> sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that <span class="we"></span> send you promptly. As <span class="were"></span> also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.</p>

<p class="payment">{{paymentSchedule}}</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">But where's all the horrible small print?</p>

<p>Just like a parking ticket, you can't transfer this contract to anyone else without <span class="our"></span> permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.</p>

<p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of {{contractorLocation}}.</p>

<p>Oh and don't forget those men with big dogs.</p>

<h4>The dotted line</h4>

<p class="signature">Signed by and on behalf of {{contractorName}} (contractor)</p>
<p class="signature">Signed by and on behalf of {{clientName}} (client)</p>
<p>Date: {{date}}</p>


<p>Everyone should sign above and keep a copy for their records.</p>
